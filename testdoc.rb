# This comment made while in play-branch. (1/6 9:38)

=begin
This comment made as a corollary to the one made in play branch.
I have edited testdoc.rb in both branches and will attempt a merge.
Side note: I have also pushed the play-branch to github using terminal
while keeping it part of the first-app project.
